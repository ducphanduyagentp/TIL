# Kernel Exploitation

## Part I - Journey to Kernel Land

### Chapter 1 - From User-land to Kernel-land attacks

- Execution contexts
    - interrupt context
        - no process is associated with it
        - hardware-generated interrupt: packets coming in, disks signaling
        - can't block or sleep
    - process context
        - system calls
        - most common, not limited as interrupt code
        - minimize interrupt code
