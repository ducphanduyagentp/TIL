## Magic - FlareOn5

- The program does dynamic code execution. There is a RWX data segment that will be decrypted to code to be called later in the program.
- In the unpack function, there is a check of the input length against a series of value.
- If the above check is passed, XOR decryption happens.
- The dynamic function call then happens. If the returned value doesn't pass the check, it encrypts the code again and return false.
- Exfiltrate function data:
    - Use manticore to extract addresses and other params to function calls.
    - Didn't work because I probably don't know how to use these symbollic execution engines
    - Manually parsed the data, because IDA decomplication got something wrong
- There are several types of check functions:
    - Calculate the n_th fibonacci number with n = ord(c)
    - Do simple arithmetic checking (equals, +13, ^0x2a)
    - AND operation
    - Short constants
    - Long constants
- Each password has 69 characters and they are checked by parts.
- And here comes r2pipe for dynamic analysis.
    - set breakpoints when the comparisons happen and get the correct value of the character, then work out the input string
    - also dumping the decrypted code can be done easily :)
- There are only 6 function calls to complicated maths. Others are trivial.
