## pwnable.tw hacknote

- There is a global array with 5 elements. Each contains a pointer to a struct Note
- Struct Note
    ```
    typedef struct Note {
        void (*func)(char *str);
        char *content;
    } Note;
    ```
- Exploitation plan
    - Since the addNote function is buggy, even if the note is deleted, you can only alloc 5 times in total
    - Alloc 2 note, then trigger double free to prepare the fastbin attack
    - Alloc 1 note. This will be the chunk that we're creating fake chunk
    - Create a fake chunk with the first pointer point to system, the second one point to "/bin/sh"
- That exploitation plan will not work because it takes at least 6 mallocs to take control of the desired pointer. I've come up with a different one.
    - Alloc chunk A: 1024
    - Alloc chunk B: 100
    - Free chunk B
    - Free chunk A
    - Now we are able to leak main_arena in chunk A's data
    - Alloc chunk C, same size as chunk A / 1024. Write 4 bytes
    - Print chunk C => main_arena get printed.
    - Free chunk C
    - Alloc chunk D / 1080, but with larger size so that it stays in the same bin as chunk B. Overflow to the data into chunk B's data to overwrite the address of the putsWrapper function to system and the pointer of the string to "/bin/sh". Or we can keep /bin/sh. But this requires leaking heap address.
    - Print chunk B (Use-After-Free) => system("/bin/sh") is called. pwned.

## Fastbin attack

- The point is to return a nearly-arbitrary pointer
- Fastbin is LIFO, singly-linked list using the FD pointer
- When a malloc is requested and the size matches a fastbin size, it checks the chunk at the top of the bin.
    - The size of the chunk to be deleted from the bin must belong to that bin
- When a free is requested and the size matches a fastbin size, it checks the following.
    - The chunk at the top must not be the same as the chunk being freed to avoid double-free. But that's it. To bypass this, we only need to free some other chunk in between to not trigger this error. For example, free(a), free(b) and then we are able to free(a) again.
- After we triggered the double-free attack, we issue 2 malloc requests.
    - a and b will be allocated again. However, a is still on the free list at the same time.
    - With that in mind, we are able to modify the metadata, change the structure of the bin
    - We will take advantage of that to create a fake fast chunk. That fake chunk will point to the nearly-arbitrary address that we want to control.
    - The fake chunk can be created as following:
        - Overwrite the FD pointer of chunk a
        - Write a fake fast_size to the fake chunk so that it doesn't trigger the check "memory corruption (fast)" in malloc.

## Unlink attack

```C
#define unlink(AV, P, BK, FD) {                                            \
    FD = P->fd;								      \
    BK = P->bk;								      \
    if (__builtin_expect (FD->bk != P || BK->fd != P, 0))		      \
      malloc_printerr (check_action, "corrupted double-linked list", P, AV);  \
    else {								      \
        FD->bk = BK;							      \
        BK->fd = FD;
    ...	
```

- Typical scenario: There's a global pointer or some pointer that we've known it's address
