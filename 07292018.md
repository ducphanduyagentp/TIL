## pwnable.tw silver_bullet

- This is an off-by-one overflow on the stack
- The createBullet function read in a buffer of 48 char maximum.
    - The string is saved on the stack (local var in main)
    - The length of the string is stored right after the string on the stack. The power of the bullet is the dword (4byte) that is right after the string.
- The powerUp function read in a string of length based on the current length stored on the stack, and then concat the input with the string on the stack
    - strncat append the src string to the dest string **THEN** place a null byte after the new string
        - len(dest) = x
        - len(src) = 48 - x
        - ==> dest[48] == bullet's strength == NULL after concat
    - Then it take dword(dest[48]) and add the length of the src string, store it at dest[48] again
        - dword(dest[48]) = dword(dest[48]) + strlen(src)
